### To Build

You can locally override the Xcode settings for code signing
by creating a `DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` file locally in the project directory.
This allows for a pristine project with code signing set up with the appropriate
developer ID and certificates, and for a developer to be able to have local settings
without needing to check in anything into source control.

Create a plain text file in it: `DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` and
give it the contents:

```text
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <Your Team ID>
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = Mac Developer
CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic
ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER = <Your Domain Name Reversed>
```

Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` to your Apple supplied development team. You can use Keychain
Access to find you Development Team ID:

* Open Keychain Access on your development machine.
* On the left-hand side, make sure "My Certificates" is selected.
* Find the certificate that reads `Apple Development: <Your Name>`
* Right click on the certificate and select "Get Info".

Your **Development Team ID** is the value next to **Organizational Unit**.

Set `ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER` to a reversed domain name that you control or have made up.

You should be able to open the `ContactManager.xccodeproj` in Xcode and build without code signing errors and without modifying
the ghNotifier Xcode project.

```shell
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
